<p>First paragraph. Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. 
And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called
Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. 
Oh. Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. Really. I don't worry. this is all wrong. 
I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?</p>

<p>Second paragraph. I'll get it back to you, alright? Leave me alone. - 
Wrecked? When did this happen and - Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts
of electricity is a bolt of lightning. Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it.</p>

<p>Third Paragraph. Ahh. Ahh. We never would have fallen in love. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Of course, 
the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. Next, please.</p>
